As mentioned in my bio, I am enthusiastic about technology. I became interested in Cyber Security and other areas while attending college. I won second place in a cyber security challenge by Booze Allen Hamilton. I have a YouTube channel (@AJTekniko) that is mostly dedicated to Spanish-language content.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on uploading YouTube videos and completing fullstack development courses.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying CSS, Python, and JavaScript.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love listening to music and exercising. 😅
